# Chatbot.com widget Google Tag Manager template

Adds a template for Chatbot.com widgets to be added with just a single Chatbot ID.

This tag template uses the sandbox JavaScript API within Google Tag Manager templates to perform the same function as the JavaScript widget embed provided by chatbot.com without needing to use Custom HTML or duplicating the JavaScript injection required manually.
